AliceOS Documentation
=====================

Welcome to the official documentation for the AliceOS project. AliceOS
is an independent, open-source project that brings a virtual operating
system into Doki Doki Literature Club! as a mod and to Ren'Py projects
as a framework. AliceOS is also the core operating system used in *Doki
Doki: The Angel Returns*.


.. attention:: This documentation rapidly changes. Expect differences and unused sections in this 
               documentation until we have a solid release.
