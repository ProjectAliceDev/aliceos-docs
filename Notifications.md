Notifications provide a level of interactivity and information updates for your Ren'Py project. The notification system built into AliceOS contains screens for both the native and custom functions regarding dialog and notification management.

## Types of notifications
There are multiple types of notifications that take inspiration from the way notifications are handled on iOS:
* _Banners_ provide a temporary pop-up at the top of the screen that has the option for a response before hiding itself after five seconds.
* _Alerts_ provide a message that requires an action, usually by pushing a button. They can be terse or have details with a title and message.
    * _Permissive alerts_ are alerts that require the player to grant access to parts of the AliceOS system. These usually include sending notifications, modifying the file system, and changing system settings.
